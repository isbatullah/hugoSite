#### <span style="color:rgb(123, 55, 184)"> My name is Isbat Ullah and I have been coding for about 4 years. I took my first computer science class in 10th grade and I was fascinated. My first project was coding a tic tac toe game with a user interface. I will post screenshots of some of my projects in the project section. I hope to become an entrepreneur and develop a business based around an app. Feel free to explore my page and contact me :) </span>
