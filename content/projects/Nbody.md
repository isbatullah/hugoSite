<span style="color:rgb(255, 161, 0)">I did this project in my Object Oriented Programming course in high school. The objective of this project was to learn how objects can communicate with each other to create an environment. I had to code the rotation of planets around the sun using information like planet and sun mass, velocity, and size. I was able to create a simulation of a universe where planets rotate around the sun.</span>
